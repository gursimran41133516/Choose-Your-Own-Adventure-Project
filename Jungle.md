Alex took a deep breath and stepped forward into the dense jungle. The towering trees blocked most of the sunlight, casting eerie shadows on the ground. Birds chirped in the distance, 
and the rustling of leaves made Alex feel as if unseen eyes were watching.
Following the map closely, Alex pushed through the thick undergrowth. 
The air smelled of damp earth and blooming flowers, but the deeper Alex ventured, the more silent the jungle became. 
Soon, Alex stumbled upon an old wooden sign covered in moss.
